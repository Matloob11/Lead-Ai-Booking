# Who did what

Three AI sessions work this repository at the same time, and they cannot see
each other. Two of them have already rewritten the same file in one afternoon,
and one shipped a change that another had to undo without knowing whose it was.
This file is how that stops: **before you start, read the last ten entries;
when you finish, add one.**

It is a log of decisions, not of commits. `git log` already says what changed —
this says *who was working on what, whether it reached the server, and whether
anybody proved it works*, which is the part a commit message cannot carry.

## The rules

1. **Add your entry when the work is done**, not when it is planned. An entry
   that says "in progress" for two days tells the next session nothing.
2. **Name the files you touched.** Especially the shared ones —
   `wa-qr/public/app.js`, `bitrix/public/assets/modules/inbox.js`,
   `ops/wa.sh`. That is the sentence that stops the next collision.
3. **Say what you verified and what you did not.** "Deployed" is not
   "working". Reaching an endpoint is not proof it does its job — see the
   Verifying section of `CLAUDE.md`. If you could not test something, write
   that down; a gap somebody knows about is not a gap.
4. **If you undo somebody's work, say whose and why.** Never silently.
5. Newest first. Keep an entry to a few lines — the detail belongs in the
   commit and in the code's own comments.

## The log

### 2026-08-05 · Opus session · `wa-qr` — agent assignment proved end to end
Did not build anything: `phones-admin.js` already carries the assignment UI, and
`MEDIA_WINDOW_MS` was already 10 days. Both were another session's work, found
by reading the files rather than by rebuilding them.
Verified live, then undone: assigned phone #7 to agent 22, and that agent went
from seeing `[]` to seeing the phone and its chats; the roster was cleared again
and the row retired rather than deleted, which is the audit trail the schema
intends. The agents dropdown reads 16 agents from Django's
`/api/catalog/agents/` through the panel's own origin.
So nothing is broken here — **no phone has been assigned because nobody has
pressed Save**, and Matloob is holding that until the rest is finished.

### 2026-08-05 · Opus session · `wa-qr` — stopped storing WhatsApp's own housekeeping
Naming system traffic `system` and hiding it in the panel left the rows being
written, and each one invented a chat, raised it to the top of the list and put
"System" where the last thing anybody said belongs. Dropped at the door now.
Repaired live: 5 rows deleted, 2 invented chats removed, 6 chats recomputed.
Files: `wa-qr/src/inbound/persist.js`, `wa-qr/public/newchat.js`.
Verified: list now opens on real conversation; 0 system rows remain.
Not verified: whether `923254595495` has more messages on the phone than the
two stored — the live client is unreachable from a separate process.

### 2026-08-05 · Opus session · `wa-qr` — voice notes and message kinds
`<audio controls>` drew the platform's white widget in a dark thread. Replaced
with a drawn player. 878 messages read "[unknown]"; the kind map now covers
polls, calls, deleted messages and the rest, and an unknown kind keeps the
library's own name for itself.
Files: `wa-qr/public/app.js`, `thread-extras.js`, `thread-extras.css`,
`wa-qr/src/inbound/normalise.js`.
Verified: all 22 raw types map as intended, tested inside the running container.
Not verified: the player in a browser.

### 2026-08-05 · Opus session · both panels — `hidden` now means hidden
The drop veil sat permanently over every thread and two empty strips sat above
every composer. Not the drag logic: `display:` on a class beats the browser's
`[hidden]`. One rule for the QR panel, one missed element in the Bitrix one.
Files: `wa-qr/public/app.css`, `bitrix/public/assets/modules/template-composer.css`.

### 2026-08-05 · Opus session · `bitrix` — CRM tab cut back to a list
Removed the thread, composer and bubbles from the CRM tab; it now lists the
record's numbers and opens the panel through `BX24.openApplication`. Deleted
`crm-thread.js`, `crm-thread.css`, `crm-template.js`.
Files: `bitrix/public/crm/*`, `ops/wa.sh` (new `panel` subcommand).
Verified against live data: 3-chat number picks the right chat, scoping holds
for a second agent.
Not verified: the tab inside Bitrix — placements are still unbound.

### 2026-08-04 · Opus session · `bitrix` — four CRM placements
`install.html` bound only LEFT_MENU. All five now, each with its own state read
from `placement.get` and its own unbind. `ensurePlacement` takes a handler.
Files: `bitrix/public/install.html`, `assets/modules/install.css`,
`assets/core/bitrix-sso.js`, `bitrix/README.md`.
Not verified: nothing is bound yet — an admin has to open `install.html`.

### 2026-08-04 · Opus session · `backend` — templates
Agents can sync templates; `create_template` was reporting Meta failures for
its own crash (`timezone` unimported) and never sent Meta the example values a
template with `{{1}}` requires. Buttons gained types.
Files: `backend/apps/catalog/views.py`,
`bitrix/public/assets/modules/template-composer.{js,css}`.
Verified live as a non-admin agent: sync 200, Meta's own validator now reaches
BUTTONS. Not verified: one successful template actually created.

### 2026-08-04 · Opus session · `wa-qr` — history import
A linked phone's own history is read into the database on first link (six
months), and only the gap since last time on reconnect. Disconnect no longer
deletes anything.
Files: `wa-qr/src/inbound/backfill.js`, `persist.js`, `sessions/*`,
`db/003_history.sql`, `wa-qr/public/*`.
Verified: 13,900 messages imported across both phones, dated correctly, unread
counts untouched.

## Known gaps, as of 2026-08-05

Things that exist but are not finished, or are finished but unproven. Take one,
then move it out of this list and into the log above.

| | |
|---|---|
| ~~Agent assignment~~ | Proved working 2026-08-05. Nothing to fix — it is waiting on a decision, not on code. |
| Media | 2,695 attachments not on disk. Some by design (outside the 10-day window), some real failures — nobody has separated the two. |
| `unknown` messages | 878 rows whose real type was thrown away. Only a re-import can recover them, and `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` currently prevents that. |
| Disconnect alert | Not built. A phone dropping should reach somebody. |
| Read on the phone | Reading a chat in the panel does not mark it read on the handset, so the customer never sees a blue tick. |
| CRM placements | Bound by nobody yet. |
| Git | No remote. Everything is on one laptop. |
